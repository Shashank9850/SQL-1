We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings 
for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number 
of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.
