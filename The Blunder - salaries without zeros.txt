Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, 
but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. 
She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), 
and the actual average salary.
Write a query to find the difference between actual average salary and that found by Samantha
